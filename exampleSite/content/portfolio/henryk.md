### About the Project

I was in charge of website development for Henryk Diamonds, a company that specializes in custom-made diamond jewelry in Canada. Henryk Diamonds wanted to have a website that showcases their products, services, and customer reviews. They also wanted to have a modern and elegant design, a simple and intuitive navigation, and a secure and convenient online ordering system.

To achieve these goals, I used the following technologies and tools:

• HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end development. I used React as a library to create a dynamic and interactive user interface for the website. I also used Sass as a preprocessor to write modular and maintainable CSS code.

• Node.js and MongoDB for the back-end development. I used Express as a framework to create a fast and flexible web server that handles the HTTP requests and responses. I also used Mongoose as an ODM to model and manipulate the data stored in MongoDB.

• PayPal for the payment integration. I used PayPal SDK to enable customers to pay securely with their PayPal account or credit card. I also used PayPal IPN to handle the payment notifications and confirmations.

• Shopify for the e-commerce platform. I used Shopify to allow Henryk Diamonds to easily manage their online store, such as adding new products, editing prices, or processing orders. I also used Shopify themes and apps to customize the look and feel of the website, such as Shella, Loox, or Privy.

I followed the best practices of web development, such as using clear and consistent code, following the RESTful API design, implementing security measures, testing and debugging the code, optimizing the performance, and documenting the code.
