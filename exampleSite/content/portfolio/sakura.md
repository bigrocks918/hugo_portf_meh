### About the Project

I was in charge of website development for Sakura Motors, a company that sells new and used cars in Japan.
Sakura Motors wanted to have a website that showcases their inventory, services, and customer testimonials. They also wanted to have a user-friendly interface, a fast and secure payment system, and a responsive design that works on different devices.

To achieve these goals, I used the following technologies and tools:

• HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end development. I used Bootstrap as a framework to create a consistent and attractive layout for the website. I also used jQuery and Ajax to add interactivity and functionality to the website.

• PHP and MySQL for the back-end development. I used Laravel as a framework to create a robust and scalable web application that connects to the database and handles the business logic. I also used Eloquent ORM to simplify the database operations and queries.

• Stripe for the payment integration. I used Stripe API to enable customers to pay securely with their credit cards or other payment methods. I also used Stripe Webhooks to handle the payment events and notifications.

• WordPress for the content management system. I used WordPress to allow Sakura Motors to easily update and manage their website content, such as adding new cars, editing services, or posting testimonials. I also used WordPress plugins to enhance the website features, such as Yoast SEO, Contact Form 7, or WooCommerce.

I followed the best practices of web development, such as using clear and semantic code, following the MVC pattern, implementing security measures, testing and debugging the code, optimizing the performance, and documenting the code.

The result was a website that met the expectations and requirements of Sakura Motors. The website was fast, secure, reliable, and easy to use. The website also increased the sales and customer satisfaction of Sakura Motors.
